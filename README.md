# CV
My up-to-date CV, opensourced.

This version is Perl/Golang/C/C++/Unix shell jobs friendly.

PS Shoutout to [@rwxrob](https://github.com/rwxrob/), whose idea to use YAML as a storage for all the data of his CV have beaten my own idea of using XML (which is better structured/typed/whatever and therefore overall is much better transformed via any template language, especially it's own XSLT, but wasn't that easy to edit). An actual source of inspiration: https://github.com/rwxrob/cv/ (go hire the guy, seriously!)
